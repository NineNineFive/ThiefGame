# ThiefGame
2D thief game made in Unity with custommade pathfinding A* solution. Was made as my Bachelor Project at Roskilde University in Computer Science and Informatics

This project is not maintained and is only for showing what i made as my bachelor at Roskilde University.
This game should not be counted as anything of high quality. It was a short 3 month project
